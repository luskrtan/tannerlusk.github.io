        <p>
          The hierarchy of this website is 1) The camping image to announce the
          "Camping Classic" sale, 2) The "Shop Deals By Category" uses large
          text and two smaller images to then provide access to shopping
          categories, 3) The "Featured" section has large text but no images to
          then show other sales, and then 4) the account, shopping-cart, search
          bar section has the smallest text but also the logo to grab the
          viewer's attention last.

        <p>
          This website uses a lot of white space to not only draw attention to
          the appealing image of the donut, but also, in contrast with the
          bright pinks and oranges fo the text and headers, serves to separate
          the different actions that can be performed on the website. This
          difference in alignment allows for two different types of searches.

        <p>
          The list of car brands is the only thing that's listed from top to
          bottom, while the different types of searches that can be performed
          are listed from left to right. This allows for two types of general
          searches to be made. If you know the car make and model but don't know
          the specific part, you can look at the top to bottom list. If you know
          the specific part, however, you can look at the left to right list to
          make a swifter search.
