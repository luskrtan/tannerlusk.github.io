<p>
    Robert (age 35) and Nancy (age 33) Gilliam just moved from San Fransisco, CA,
    with their two kids Jack and Emily to Soda Springs, Idaho. Robert, is still employed as a software developer
    with his same company in California, and will be working from home. Nancy was employed
    as a teacher, but is wanting to be a stay at home mom for the time being. The whole family 
    loves being outdoors, but they especially miss being close to the beach, so they are most eager
